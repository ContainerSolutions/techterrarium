# TechTerrarium

## Introduction

*TechTerrarium* is an open-source project dedicated to streamline infrastructure
deployment, facilitate internal learning, empower sales demos, and provide the
basis for engaging, informative content creation. At its core, it is a
multifaceted, modular development environment designed to foster exploration and
experimentation.

It is envisioned as a versatile and interactive platform that allows us to
craft, test, and compare Cloud Native solutions. It provides a centralized,
reusable environment where we can simulate infrastructure deployments, run
experiments, and create demos.
